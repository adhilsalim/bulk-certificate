A repo that helps you to create certificates📑 in bulk easily

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/zameel7/1fc832872ca614d0bbc27b6ac4fd853e/autocertificate.ipynb)

## Requirements to execute the file: -
  1. a Gmail account💌 for the requirement of Google Colab😅.
  2. an internet connection for executing code in colab.
  3. minute know how of 🐍python programming language  and 😏knack to learn.[basic knowledge of ```Google Colab```,```Pandas```,```OpenCV``` is a ➕ point but not a mandate.]
  
## How to execute the code: -

Simply click on the run button in Collab for each cell. The ```▶``` button on the left hand corner of each cell.


## Understanding the code: -

1. **Import all the necessary files needed for processing.**

2. **Now in order to create the certificates in bulk, we need names in bulk, which must be provided in an excel file and the same must be uploaded in the window when asked for during execution.**

3. **The ```Pandas``` module is used to read excel files and then extract data from them wherein the user needs to specify the column names explicitly, which shall be made even more customizable in future.🔮.**

4. **Upload the template of the certificate as *```.png```* through the files explorer of Colab and then rename the same to something creative yet simple and lucid.**

6. **(Now real cheesy🧀 layer comes into play😋)** Print the name at the location of the mouse pointer on the template using ```OpenCV```.

7. **Finally, the certificates are saved in the provided location.**
